## Logistics

- Make sure everyone has a way to work on this codebase, with a common set of tools.
- Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.e. everyone should have some commits in the project log)
- Start by defining your minimum viable product. (See milestones section)

## Assignment Milestones

1. [First List your Minimum Viable Product](./mvp.md) (Note: This part should be pushed to github before you start working and within 1 week of opening your repository.)
2. [Part 1 README](./part1_README.md) -- Note there is only 1 part to the final project after the MVP

**Note**: There is only 1 part to the final project.
