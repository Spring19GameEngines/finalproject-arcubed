A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest subset of features that you consider a project to be a success. Make a list below of the features you consider to be in your MVP. Then make a list of features that are 'stretch goals' that you think you can achieve.

The goal of this exercise is to first define what you will be building and give your instructors early on a chance to tell you if you are doing too much or too little work.

(TODO: Edit these)
Minimal Subset of Features you **will** definitely implement.
- *feature 1*
- *feature 2*
- *etc.*

Strecth Goals:
- *features 1*
- *feature 2*
- *etc.*


Note: It is possible you do not hit all of your stretch goals. You should not edit this document to attempt to make your plan look perfect either.
